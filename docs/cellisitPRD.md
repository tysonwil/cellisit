# PRD: Cellisit 201 Anti-Hairloss Therapy Shampoo Website

## 1. Overview

**Goal**  
Create a direct-to-consumer e-commerce website that spotlights the scientifically backed “Cellisit 201 Anti-Hairloss Therapy Shampoo.” The site must showcase:
- The **Plasma PLM Extraction Method** (unique waterless/solvent-free extraction).
- **Credibility and certifications** (FDA, KFDA, OECD, patents).
- **Customer testimonials** and easy online purchasing.

Because this is going to an AI developer, assume:
- Potential for AI-driven features (e.g., a chatbot that answers FAQ, or dynamic content recommendations).
- Emphasis on speed of development with minimal overhead; a small, maintainable, low-cost solution.

## 2. Target Audience

- **Primary**: Adults dealing with thinning hair or scalp issues, seeking a **scientifically proven**, premium solution.
- **Secondary**: Consumers interested in **natural/herbal** hair-care products, especially those with sensitive scalps.
